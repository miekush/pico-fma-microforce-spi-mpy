# Raspberry Pi Pico Honeywell FMA Microforce SPI MicroPython Module

This is a Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython module for the Honeywell FMA Microforce series force sensors using SPI interface

# Wiring

By default, Pico SPI instance 0 is used, however this can be changed in the constructor along with the MISO, SCK, and CS pins.

# Breakout

To help with evaluation, I designed a simple breakout in KiCad that supports all variants of the FMA series. See the repo for design files and ordering info.
